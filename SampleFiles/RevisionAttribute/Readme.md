# Start point for revision attribute testing

[RevisionAttribute.rtz](./RevisionAttribute.rtz)

Based on the defaultWaypoint.rtz sample but everywaypoint has a revision attribute starting at waypoint id plus 10.

Test text is:

6.9.8
m)	Create or import a route that uses the revision attribute. Modify data for one Waypoint and modify Leg data for a different waypoint on the same route and export the route. Confirm by observation that the Waypoint revision counter has been incremented for both Waypoints.

This is to help with the "import a route..." part of that.
